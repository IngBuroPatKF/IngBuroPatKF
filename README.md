Hi!

My name is Patrick Kraus-Füreder and I am founder (and currently sole employee) of the Ingenieurbüro Patrick Kraus-Füreder.
For the non-german speakers - "Ingenieurbüro" mostly means consulting agency.
As of now I am mainly consulting in the topics of designing measurement devices (real, physical devices) and FEM / CFD simulation.
I am working full time (next to my consulting business) as a computer vision engineer and want to expand my knowledge and ability in deep learning technology.
The direction I mainly want to take is to understand and to be able to apply numerous techniques to "look into the black box" and thus
further my ability to make "AI explainable".

As I am currently still very early in my journey the experiments on this repository might be rather ... basic.
But I hope they will soon progress and maybe even be useful for you guys and gals out there.

Please feel free to contact me for any questions or tipps at
patrick.kraus@krausp.at

best,
Pat
